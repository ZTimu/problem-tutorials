Let's make this statement bit easier, we will not focus on the whole statement.
In this problem the most confusing part is "When he tells a lie, his nose grows at least 1 cm and at most 5 cm". After each day his nose become 2 cm and they asked
the minimum number of lie he lied in each given test case. since the nose can increase between (1 cm  5 cm) after each lie but we can not say that after each lie 
nose size will increase by one, if we do that, then we are ignoring 2,3,4,5 cm, surely!

since the setter asked the minimum number of lies and ignoring 5 cm will be a"Faux pa"(wrong attempt).Because if we take 1 cm after each lie for the testcase:

1
5
2 3 3 3 5

it will give us 3 but the ovious answer is 2. How!. Let's have a look:
initially the length is 2 and after each truth and waking up length becomes 2.

index 0 1 2 3 4
value 2 3 3 3 5
now in position 0(first period of the day), we can clearly say that, he didnt told any lie, since the nose length is 2. and 1 lie, 0 lie, 0 lie, 2 lie
on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th period of the day respectively and total lie is 3. but we know on the 5th day he told maximum 2 lies, but the setter ask for
the minimum lies.thats why we will consider the nose size will increase by 5 cm but, if the size is less that 5 and greater than 2, then we can say he lied
atleast 1 by considering 1 cm(size increase after each lie)

Still confused?
Ok, Let me ease you!

Focus on the statement "When he tells a lie, his nose grows at least 1 cm and at most 5 cm". Does his nose increase only 1 or 5? Surely no! it can be increased by
2 and 3 also. So, we can say that, if his nose size is 5, his nose increases by 3 after 1 lie which is a minimum possible lie, if we consider 5 cm then he didnt lied, 
Which is not true!

approch:
1: simply subtruct arr[i] from arr[i-1]
2: subtract 2 from arr[0] and divide by 5(for minimum lies);
3: the value doesn't change means he didnt lied (maybe these values are recorded after some periods, took it in mind, Otherwise you will think of subtruct 2 fromn
every value).

C++ code:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long
#define d double
#define endl "\n"

int main(){
    ios_base :: sync_with_stdio(0);
	  cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0);
    ll m=0,cse=0;
    cin >> m;
   
    while (m--)
    {
       cse++;
       ll n;
       double result = 0;
       cin >> n;
       ll arr[n];
       for (int i = 0; i < n;i++){
           cin >> arr[i];
       }
       result += ceil((arr[0] - 2) / 5.0);

       for (int i = 1; i < n;i++){
           result += ceil((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) / 5.0);
       }
       cout<<"Case "<<cse<<": "<<result<<endl;
    }          	

	return 0;
}

# Happy coding!
